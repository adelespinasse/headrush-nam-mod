mx5_viewer.py -- host-side viewer for mx5_screen_server.

Shows the HeadRush MX5's screen in a window and sends mouse clicks back as
touch events. Talks to the device over the second USB CDC-ACM channel.

    # Windows
    python mx5_viewer.py COM7
    # Linux / macOS
    python mx5_viewer.py /dev/ttyACM1

Requires: pyserial, pygame   (pip install pyserial pygame)

Notes
-----
* The MX5's framebuffer is portrait 480x800 while the UI is landscape 800x480 --
  the panel is mounted rotated. This viewer rotates for display and rotates
  mouse coordinates back before sending them, so clicking what you see works.
* Serial read sizing is the single most important detail here, and it cuts both
  ways -- both mistakes were made and measured on real hardware:
    - The host's *driver* buffer should be large (set_buffer_size below).
      Leaving it at the 4 KB default throttled the link from ~12 MB/s to
      ~0.6 MB/s.
    - But never ask read() for more bytes than you actually need. pyserial's
      read(n) blocks until n bytes arrive OR the timeout expires, so
      "read(65536) for batching" makes every read timeout-bound instead of
      data-bound. That alone produced multi-second lag, and the resulting
      mid-frame timeouts caused stream desyncs. See Reader._fill.
* The server sends only tiles that changed, so an idle screen costs no
  bandwidth. Full frames are sent on request ('K') and as a periodic safety net.
